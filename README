NAME
    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::cover - Code coverage metrics for your
    distribution

VERSION
    version 1.101000

SYNOPSIS
        # dzil cover -outputdir /my/dir

DESCRIPTION
    This is a command plugin for Dist::Zilla. It provides the "cover"
    command, which generates code coverage metrics for your distribution
    using Devel::Cover.

    If there were any test errors, the "cover" command won't be run. Author
    and release tests are not run since they should not be counted against
    code coverage. Any additional command-line arguments are passed to the
    "cover" command.

INSTALLATION
